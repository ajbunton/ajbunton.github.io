            	<h2>About the Band</h2>
                <p>The current incarnation of Something Negative About Scotland was formed in 2008 in Kochi, Japan. In 2009, the intense spotlight of relative anonymity proved too much, and now bandmembers "British" Andrew Durham, Noah Brennan, and "Sexy" Andrew Bunton are spread around the world.  That doesn't mean, however, that the rock has ended. </p>
                <p>Though all three members of SNAS are now married (not to each other), and have persevered through graduate school, SNAS has evolved for the 21st Century.  Using state of the art and highly expensive (lies!) equipment, SNAS has become the poster child of cloud-based, decentralized, asynchronous, and collaborative music making (whatever that means). <span>This is SNAS</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="mainContent">
            	<h3>Noah Brennan</h3>
                <h4>Bass, Sax, Vocals, Djembe</h4>
                <p>Noah slaps a mean bass and stays sexy on the saxophone for SNAS, while occasionally lending his sweet vocal stylings on songs such as "The Ballad of Craig."  Noah was born and raised in the pleasant countryside of Dubuque, Iowa, or as he likes to call it "The Masterpiece on the Mississippi," or something like that, I usually blank out when he talks about Iowa, since it always ends up being a rant about corn. Before SNAS, Noah rocked with Dubuque's very own iHOR.</p>  
                <p>When still in Japan, Noah resided in Tano, where he worked as a CIR writing children's plays and mastering the game of chess. Tano was also home to SNAS's practice facilities, a raucous spare room in Noah's luxiurious apartment dwelling. The amount of spaghetti consumed in this apartment before SNAS practices still baffles scientists to this day.</p>
                <p>Noah went on to terrorize a Japanese museum on the small island of Naoshima, where he worked for a time, but later left in a rage after his boss overhead Noah arguing with a local kindergartener about whether a watermelon is a fruit or vegetable. After his boss sided with the kid, Noah caught the first ship off of Naoshima, never to return again. Today, Noah spends his days in sunny Southern California with his wife Ryo. Noah was temporarily relocated to Washington D.C. for an "internship" with "the government." We can't say what he really did in America's capital, but we might be able to suggest that whatever it is, it might rhyme with "schmcrete schmervice lodyguard." Maybe. I mean, its either that or was appointed Secretary of Corn.</p>

        		<h3>"Sexy" Andrew Bunton</h3>
            	<h4>Drums - Occasional Bass and Vocals</h4>
            	<p>Andrew is usually behind the kit for SNAS, which means he's typically relegated to the back of the stage and out of the spotlight, which is good as bright lights have been known to cause relapses for Andrew's tragic peanut-brittle addiction. Andrew occasionally gets out from behind to kit to lay down a bass groove or two, or to woo the audience by singing "Business Time."</p>
            	<p>While in Japan, Andrew lived in the thriving metropolis of Aki, the geographic center of SNAS. After a renouned analytical breakdown of the education uses of "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes," Andrew was recruited by a school in Memphis, Tenessee to further his research into "Duck, Duck, Goose." However, the call of the Tenessee wilderness was too great, so Andrew grew a beard and promptly lost his research endowment.</p>
            	<p>Andrew then moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he worked for an international hotel company to support his peanut-brittle addiction. Andrew eventually "got off the crunch," went back to school, and got a job at a local university. We're proud to report that Andrew has been peanut-brittle free for four years now, but has unfortunately kept the beard.</p>

        	<div class="mainContent">
        		<h3>"British" Andrew Durham</h3>
        		<h4>Guitar, Vocals, Sometimes Bass</h4>
        		<p>British</p>
        		<p>Andrew lays down the lixx for SNAS, and has been known to shred on occasion.  Andrew also generally pulls double duty, providing vocals for most SNAS jams as well.  Andrew's voice has been compared to a young Kurt Vonnegut before, but we're not really sure what that means.</p>
        		<p>In Japan, Andrew lived in the village of Geisei, which actually hired SNAS for offical city and school events.  The village still hasn't recovered. </p>
            	<p>Andrew was mad enough to go to grad school while in the middle of the height of SNAS's popularity in Japan.  As a result, all of Andrew's research was strongly influenced by tonkatsu.  Thanks to this obsession, Andrew is currently one of the leading experts in the burgeoning katsu field.  This expertise landed Andrew a job at Kochi University. Due to some strange character quirks brought about by prolonged exposure to the Japanese country-side, Andrew's students began to refer to him as "Professor Marmalade."</p>
                <p>Andrew then moved to Kochi City, where he and his wife had two children.  We were promised that he was going to name one of them "Snastopher," but that didn't happen.  We're all still pretty upset about that.</p> 
                <p>The entire Durham clan has since moved back to Andrew's native England, meaning that all ties to the band's orignal Kochi home have been severed. Man...that took a turn for the dark, didn't it?</p>

            	<h3>Jimmy Hawthorne</h3>
                <h4>Keyboard, Lead Vocals, Funk Triangle, Deceased?</h4>
                <p>Jimmy was widely held as the heart and soul of SNAS before his mysterious disappearance.  Many have said that SNAS hasn't been the same since Jimmy's separation from the band, others agree.  Jimmy was the creative force behind the band, writing several original songs, and rocketing SNAS to popularity in Kochi.  Under Jimmy's watch, SNAS booked several sucessful gigs, and poised the band for stardom.  The official line is that in order to honor Jimmy's possible passing, SNAS decided to retire Jimmy's songs and instead focus on covers.  The reality is that SNAS simply can't remember any of Jimmy's songs and have since resorted to covers.  Unfortunately, without Jimmy SNAS has fallen in popularity and has been unable to replicate their earlier success.</p>
                <p>The circumstances surrounding Jimmy's disappearance make the mystery even more perplexing.  Jimmy left band practice one night to make a routine burrito run, saying he would be back in "just a couple minutes."  When Jimmy didn't return several hours later, the other band members grew concerned, and contacted the police.  The Police reported that there was no record of a Jimmy Hawthorne having ever lived in Kochi, nor could they contact his place of work, or any friends or relatives.  To this day Jimmy's whereabouts are unknown.</p>
                <p>There are several theories as to what happened to Jimmy Hawthorne.  Some have said that he was abducted by the Yakuza, only to later join them in an international drug trafficking ring.  Others have said that he used his burrito money on booze, and either drank himself to death, or got drunk and fell into the ocean and drowned.  There are even some who say that he grew bored of his SNAS life, got plastic surgery, changed identities, and moved to Siberia.  Its currently unknown if Jimmy is alive or dead.  Jimmy, if you're out there somewhere reading this, you still owe me five bucks.</p>
