                <p>On man, we actually made a song! This whole Internet band thing might actually work! We've put it up for your listening pleasure below.  It won't work in Firefox, so if that's you, go get a supported browser, jerk!</p>

                <p>SNAS is back, and better than ever!  We're moving into the digital realm and living up in the cloud.  Look out cherubs, you're about to rocked like you've never know before!  Check back soon for updates and eventual audial delights!</p>

            	<h3>Postmortem</h3>
                <p>Dude!  A postmortem blog post!  Does that mean we're awesome undead rocking zombies!?  Wait...what's that?  Oh, ok.  I've just been informed by our lawyers that no, we are not undead rocking zombies.  Damn.  I hope the zombies still let us fight on their side when the great zombie uprising occurs.</p>
    			<p>Anyway, on to buisness [sic].  You may remember that we at one point had a record deal to create an official SNAS album for your listening pleasure, but we were screwed by The Man and lost or deal.  Well, we decided to not take things laying down.  We decided to put on ninja skillz to use, and take back what was rightfully ours!  On a dark and damp night, we snuck into the recording studio, hacked into their mainframe, and took all we could find.  We managed to get our hands on 7 (yes 7!) of our songs, which while not enough for a full album, is plenty for an EP.  So no we're self-publishing our only EP ever.  We're calling it "The Illicit EP."  The sound quality isn't real great, but beggars can't be choosers, especially when it comes to questionably obtained sound files.</p>  
    			<p>In further good news, we have some video footage of the Kochi stop on our farewell tour: Melsie Mayhem.  We illegally confiscated footage...I mean...had a friend friend film parts of the concert, which we're now making available on DVD, with the help of some of our corporate friends.  If you would like a copy of either The Illicit EP on CD or Melsie Mayhem on DVD, send us an email at <a href="mailto:snas.rock@gmail.com">snas.rock@gmail.com</a>, and we'll get your order in the mail as soon as possible. </p> 
    			<p>Well that's it.  Time to go back to retirement.  Zomebies, give us a call when the time comes.  Stay sexy and rock on, everyone.</p>

            	<h3>Retirement</h3>
                <p>The show at Altec was a resounding success!  Socks were rocked, ladies swooned, babies were hi-fived, and dudes cried.  The greatness of the show, however, is bittersweet, as it shall be SNAS's last.  Yes, we're disbanding. </p> 
    			<p>There are several reasons for this.  We first noticed a few rifts after Andrew (British) was abducted by pirates for six months.  When he finally came back, he reeked of rum and had lost his left hand.  We never found out what happened to his hand, but trying to play guitar with a hook for a hand doesn't really work too well.  Andrew (Sexy) also suffered a peanut brittle relapse during this time.  After months and thousands of dollars in peanut brittle rehab, Andrew fell into dispractice, and never fully regained his drumming chops.  While the Andrews were sailing the seven seas and in rehab, Noah hit a bit of a rough patch himself.  He finally snapped after spending two years teaching English in Japan.  The final straw came when several of his students insisted that watermelon is a vegetable.  Noah's brain just couldn't take it, and he suffered a nervous breakdown.  Noah still mumbles to himself quite a bit, the only audible words being "watermelon," and "fruit."  </p>
    			<p>Because of all the adversity SNAS has faced recently, we have decided that the show at Altec would be our last.  We'd like to thank all our fans for supporting us all this time.  We're looking forward to seeing you all on the reunion tour in 2015. [ed. note: 2015 appears to have been a bit optimistic. The reunion tour will actually commence in 2022! Mark your calendars!]  So for one last time, rock on and stay sexy!</p>

            	<h3>TAKE THAT LIMEY!</h3>
                <p>Thanks again to everyone who came out to Cadiz and got rocked back to the...well not stone age...maybe the early Renaissance.  We had a great time, and look forward to rocking again.  If you have any photos from the gig that show off our manly physiques, be sure to email them to us at <a href="mailto:snas.rock@gmail.com">snas.rock@gmail.com</a>!  If we think our butts look sexy enough, we'll post them on the site!  Now's your chance to gain fame as a SNAS groupie, so act now!  Until later, rock on and stay sexy!</p>

            	<h3>British Way Round!</h3>
                <p>Well, Noah's in Okinawa, Andrew's in Chicago - looks like it's down to the great one himself to let you legions of SNAS fans know what we're up to. Recently SNAS have been looking for Jimmy's lost songs - it seems he's taken them to the grave with him ... or the Mexican shop ... or where-ever the hell he is! In short, our Peruvian expedition proved in vain. Also, Noah has been riding whale sharks in Okinawa while training them up to attack at his command. Meanwhile Andrew (the sexy one) has been masquerading as George Washington in Virginia - Andrew (the British one) is currently on his way to retrieve him from local police custody.</p>
    			<p>Anyway - wishing all you fans out there a Merry Xmas and Happy New Year. And remember - If its not SNAS approved ... its not worth buying!</p>

            	<h3>New Gig!</h3>
                <p>SNAS has booked a new gig for your rocking pleasure!  We're be putting on a concert that is sure to leave Kochi City in ruins.  Here's the important info.</p>
    			<ul>
                	<li>Friday, January 16th - 8PM</li>
    				<li>Cadiz Restaurant (In downtown Kochi near Louis Vuitton)</li>
     				<li>1,500 Yen - Includes a drink</li>
    				<li>Kids and old people not allowed</li>
                </ul>

            	<h3>Crap...</h3>
                <p>So it would seem that we've been neglecting our blogging duties to all our loyal fans (hi Mom!).    Don't worry, every one in the band is doing just fine.  Noah just wrestled a tiger on live TV the other day, Andrew (British) was recently knighted in small county in Peru, and Andrew (sexy) has been working on an analytical analysis of "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes."  As a result, the SNAS website has been on the back burner a bit, but rest assured, SNAS continues to rock on!  In fact, we have exciting news for all of you soon, so check back early and often to find out what we're currently keeping secret from you.  I'll give you a hint, its not a puppy.  Until later, stay sexy!</p>
