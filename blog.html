					<h2>So it's been a while...</h2>

					<div class="date">07/05/2015</div>

					<p>As I was going back to copy my old wordpress blog onto this new website, I realized that I haven't actually updated this thing in about a year and half. That's not because I don't have anything to say, but mostly because I've let this thing fall on the backburner. This has always really been more an avenue for me to get my thoughts down rather than a "publication" that I expect other people to actually read. That said, I'll try to maybe update this thing a bit more moving forward. Maybe...we'll see how it goes.</p>

					<h2>My old Wordpress Archive</h2>
					
					<div class="date">07/05/2015</div>

					<p>I originally planned to actually copy some of my old blog articles over here and save you a click if you were actually interested in reading them, but then I realized they were all from 2012, and were looking a little bit outdated. I wrote an article about Codecademy and Kahn Academy that described both sites as they were about three years ago, so I don't really think it's fair to post those here as though they contain any kind of recent insight (though I think everything still stands from a 2012 point of view). I did write one on <a href="https://ajbunton.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/is-it-time-to-deemphasize-college-sports/" target="_new">college sports</a> that I still really like, but that's probably the best of the bunch. </p>
					
					<p>Anyway, my point is that if you're really interested in reading my blog archive (and let's face it, that's probably none of you), everything is still avilable over at my wordpress at <a href="https://ajbunton.wordpress.com/" target="_new">ajbunton.wordpress.com</a>. Enjoy!
