				<p>It's hard to write something like this about yourself without it sounding weird, but I'll give it a shot. I live in Omaha, Nebraska, which is a surprisingly awesome town. Being a transplant, I used to think of Omaha as one of those little cities out west that couldn't be the home of anything fun. Turns out I was wrong, and I love Omaha now. It's full of great people, good food, fun places, and a cost of living that is just plain stupid. </p>

				<p>I work at Creighton University as an Instruction Designer, which is a fancy way of saying that I'm a technology and teaching coach for professors. If you've checked out the <a href="blog.html">blog</a>, you know that I have...opinions...about education and technology.</p>

				<p>On a slightly more serious note, I do firmly believe that technology can make a big difference in education. The problem is that it's so rarely implemented in a way that actually works or makes sense. My belief is that you should never use technology just for the sake of using technology, and that you shouldn't have to be a tech nerd (like me) to undertand and use technology. That's why my main professional goal is to make technology more accessible and understandable, and to help design curriculum and instruction to take advantage of technology, not be hindered by it.</p>

				<p>I also love baseball, and am a huge Chicago Cubs fan (which probably means that I'm a masochist). I also enjoy playing games, both board games and video games. I'm not as into the huge AAA games like Call of Duty, but moreso the smaller and more ambitious indie games. If someone wanted to pay me to get a PhD, I'd love to study the intersection of games and education. Don't get me started on "gamification," though, I'll get on my little soapbox and it'll take forever to get me down.</p>
