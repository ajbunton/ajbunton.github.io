Unfortunately, a massive typhoon also struck Kochi City the same night, downing power lines and leaving thousands without power for days.  This same power outage also affected SNAS as the venue lost all power just before SNAS started to play.  The concert was promptly canceled.</p>

However, while playing "Duck, Duck, Goose" with the students before the show, drummer Andrew Bunton sprained his ankle chasing a 6 year old around the circle and could no longer play.  The show was indefinitely postponed.</p>

The day was to be a sad one, however, as the previous night lead singer and keyboardist Jimmy Hawthorne failed to return  from a routine burrito run.  The band took the stage, but couldn't remember any of Jimmy's music, and instead sang "If you're happy and you know it" before being booed off the stage.</p>

                		<p>SNAS rocked downtown Kochi in the restaurant Cadiz.  Many who attended the show were left unable to fully function afterward.  The restaurant itself was left a smoldering crater, and no pants were to be found within a quarter mile radius of the epicenter.  The original plans were to donate all the proceeds from the show to a local childrens' hospital.  However, when the hospital found the proceeds to be SNAS blood money, they refused the donation, and the money instead went towards damages incurred at Cadiz.</p>

From there, SNAS moved on to Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; London, England; Chicago, Illinois, USA; and Dubuque, Iowa, USA.  In their wake, they left a path of destruction, all the while rocking their way to glory, love, and really expensive hotel bills. </p>

                <p>I suppose that if Quetzalcoatl doesn't destory us all later this year, there might be chance that we actually play a live show at some indeterminate point in the future.  If that does actually happen, we'll probably post about it here at some point.....no promises, though.</p>
