                <p>This is all of SNAS's legacy music, so there's no guarantee that this will in any way reflect the new SNAS project.  In fact, we'll probably be updating this very page soon to let you see and (and hear?) what the band in working on.  In the mean time, take a look at the SNAS glory days.</p>
                <p>Let's say you saw SNAS live.  Let's also say you thought to yourself afterward "man, those guys kicked ass!  I wonder where I can hear slightly less awesome versions of the songs they played?"</p>  
    			<p>Well my friend, you've come to the right place.  Here in the "Music of SNAS," we'll be detailing where all our inspiration came from.  Listed first is the song name, then the original artist, and the album on which is can be found.  Finally, we'll include any SNAS notes that we might deem necessary.  Let's rock!</p>

    						Noah - Djembe<br />
    						Sexy Andrew - Bass</p>
    						<p>Andrew pulls out the acoustic for this song and sets the mood just right.  Ladies swoon, babies cry, and dudes are moved to the verge of tears, but act tough.  Noah also shows of his troubadour skillz with one of his many SNAS instruments, or SNAStruments.</p>

    					Sexy Andrew - Drums</p>
    					<p>This song really shows off some of SNAS's skills, with rockin' guitar lixx, funky bass groves, and thumping drum beat.  Jack White is represented as SNAS strives to steal from all the great modern guitarists.</p>

    					<p>SNAS rewrote the lyrics and changed the name of this song for "Scotland Appreciation Week" in 2005.  This version was far more popular because of the rousing chorus of "Go now you dirty skiver."  SNAS never looked back.</p>

    					<p>SNAS pulled out this classic to celebrate the birthday of a good friend of the band, Ryo, and now Noah's wife. Ryo's birthday was just a couple of days after SNAS's final concert, so they played it for her in the middle of their set.  Not only did SNAS celebrate Ryo's birthday, but they rocked so hard that even your dad was on the dance floor.</p>

    					<p>Noah and Sexy Andrew work overtime on this one, kicking ass and taking names.  Shooting first and asking questions later.  Plowing the fields, and reaping the harvest.  Maybe I took that metaphor too far.  Andrew sings this song like a banshee from hell, and its awesome. </p>

    					<p>This is one of two SNAS songs to date to feature a good friend of the band, Erin (now actually Sexy Andrew's wife).  She wails on the keyboard, while sharing singing duties with Andrew.  General consensus, rock.</p>

    					<p>SNAS gets their punk rock on, taking this song from their favorite Swedes.  The only thing that could have made this song any better, Swedish Fish.  Man those things are good!</p>

    					<p>While this song totally rocks, it also seriously wears SNAS out.  Playing this song usually leaves all of SNAS panting and wiping the sweat from their heads.  Also, because of this song, the muscles in Sexy Andrew's right arm are way bigger than the left. </p>

    					<p>One of the original SNAS 3 along with "The Ballad of Craig" and "Pressure Point."  It doesn't matter how many time you hear it, its always awesome.  Also, the band has a man-crush on  Dave Grohl.</p>

    					Noah - Slap Bass<br />
    					Sexy Andrew - Drums</p>
    					<p>Noah rocks this song pretty hard.  You just have to be careful that he doesn't rock it too hard.  Too prove my point, SNAS has played this whole song in under 1 minute 30.</p>

    					Noah - Bass<br />
    					Sexy Andrew - Drums</p>
    					<p>British Andrew really stretches his vocal range with this one.  Not only does he have to sing the rediciously high chorus, but he also has the play the crazy hot lixx on guitar.  Bonus points on this song for coordinated clapping.</p>

    					<p>Manic Street Preachers are Welsh?  Really?  And they wrote good music?  I don't understand.  Apparently the song is all political or something.  I just always thought it was about being indoors.</p>

    					Noah - Bass<br />
    					Sexy Andrew - Drums</p>
    					<p>Noah really goes crazy on bass in this one, and I mean that in the best possible sense.  The Andrews do some pretty heavy rocking in this one as well, while the presence of this song futher solidifies the fact that the band secretly worships Dave Grohl. </p>

    					<p>The second SNAS song featuring Erin.  Erin literally knocked the socks off of SNAS the first time they heard her sing this song.  No seriously, they had to break for 10 minutes just to find the missing socks.</p>

    					<p>This is a SNAS song that never came to be.  As the second Japanese song SNAS planned to play, they arranged to have good friend of the band Petey P come on for guest vocals on this one.  However, the week before the song's debut, Petey P took a headbutt to the throat during a vicious game of Beach Sumo.  The song, unfortunately, had to be struck from the set list.</p>

    					<p>While the recent Weezer stuff hasn't been too hot, their early work is still awesome.  Take "Surf Wax" for example.  SNAS highly encourages mosh pits during this song*.</p>
                    	<p style="font-size:smaller">*Note - SNAS's lawyer does not encourage mosh pits...ever.</p>
                        <p>Even better, with the new SNAS:DAMN initiative, you can now hear this very song!  It's the first song we ever recorded like this, and it proved that this crazy Internet band thing kinda actually works.  Check it out!</p>

    					<p>SNAS likes to play this one immediately following "I Believe in a Thing Called Love," running the end of "I Believe" right into the very first note of "Take Me Out."  The result is an awesome rock marathon that leaves fans in awe, and their jaws on the dancefloor. </p>
