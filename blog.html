					<h2>So it's been a while...</h2>

					<div class="date">10/31/14</div>

					<p>As I was going back to copy my old wordpress blog onto this new website, I realized that I haven't actually updated this thing in about a year and half. That's not because I don't have anything to say, but mostly because I've let this thing fall on the backburner. This has always really been more an avenue for me to get my thoughts down rather than a "publication" that I expect other people to actually read. That said, I'll try to maybe update this thing a bit more moving forward. Maybe...we'll see how it goes.</p>
