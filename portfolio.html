				<p>Most of the work that I do is proprietary or copywritten work that I can't freely share. That said, I did create a couple of kind of silly examples that hopefully at least show of the way I think about instructional design and technology. I did also hand code this site, as well as the <a href="/SNAS/SNAS.html">SNAS</a> site. I also have an incredibly goofy proof-of-concept project that I developed in Unity that I can share with you if you're interested.</p>
				<p>In a slightly more professional context, as an Instructional Designer at Creighton University, I'm the lead designer for several nationally ranked online programs. Not that I can take full credit for those rankings, but I like to think I play a role in that.
